# Phone Book Project: Student Instructions

Welcome! This project will guide you step by step to build a command-line Phone Book application in Python. Each step is described in the `phone-book.ipynb` notebook, with instructions, hints, and expected outputs.

**How to use this project:**
- Write your code in a separate file called `phonebook.py` as you follow the steps in the notebook.
- Use the notebook cells to test ideas, but your final solution should be in `phonebook.py`.
- When you finish, you can compare your solution to the provided `phonebook.py` file in this folder.

**Note:**
The complete answer is available in the `phonebook.py` file. Use it to check your work or get unstuck, but try to solve each step on your own first!
